# Anesthesia_oscillation_Na_K_pump_Izhikevich

Simulation of anesthesia related brain slow oscillations by controlling Na+/K+-ATPase pump.

Similar mechanism to models used in: 

Ching and Brown 2015's "Modeling the Dynamical Effects of Anesthesia on Brain Circuits"  

Joo et al. 2021's "Network Model With Reduced Metabolic Rate Predicts Spatial Synchrony of Neuronal Activity"
