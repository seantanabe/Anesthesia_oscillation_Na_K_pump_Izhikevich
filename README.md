# Anesthesia_oscillation_Na_K_pump_Izhikevich

Simulating anesthesia-related brain slow oscillations by controlling the Na+/K+-ATPase pump. Using Izhikevich neurons, I also applied Izhikevich groups to understand the intrinsic information content of the wakefulness vs. anesthetic state. The scripts include several other unpublished analyses.

Similar mechanism to models used in: 

Ching and Brown 2015's "Modeling the Dynamical Effects of Anesthesia on Brain Circuits"  

Joo et al. 2021's "Network Model With Reduced Metabolic Rate Predicts Spatial Synchrony of Neuronal Activity"
